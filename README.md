# Markdown Live Viewer

This project provides a simple, single-file HTML application (`index.html`) designed to render Markdown content from an `input.md` file directly in your browser. It leverages `marked.js` for Markdown parsing and Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive user interface.

## Features

*   **Markdown to HTML Conversion:** Converts `input.md` into beautifully formatted HTML using the `marked.js` library.
*   **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a great viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes.
*   **Easy Deployment:** A single HTML file makes deployment incredibly simple â€“ just open `index.html` in your web browser alongside `input.md`.
*   **Local File Support:** Designed to fetch and render `input.md` from the same directory, making it perfect for local documentation or quick previews.

## Getting Started

To use this Markdown viewer:

1.  Save the `index.html` file into a directory.
2.  Place your Markdown content in a file named `input.md` in the *same directory* as `index.html`.
3.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.

The content of `input.md` will automatically be loaded and rendered on the page.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** Structure of the web page.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** For styling and responsive design.
*   **Marked.js:** For fast Markdown parsing and rendering.
